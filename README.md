## Data Science Projects
### Predictive Climate Analysis
**Description**: This project showcases my Python skills through a comprehensive analysis and prediction of temperatures in India. I initiated the project by meticulously cleaning the dataset, followed by exploratory data analysis to uncover underlying patterns. The data was then segmented into testing and working sets to prepare for predictive modeling. I applied ARIMA, SARIMA, and FB Prophet models, each analyzed for their predictive performance, with a focus on understanding their handling of seasonality in climatic data.

**Technologies and Tools Used**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Numpy, ARIMA, SARIMA, FB Prophet

**Key Achievements**:
- Demonstrated superior performance of FB Prophet in handling seasonality compared to ARIMA and SARIMA.
- Highlighted the robust capabilities of FB Prophet in forecasting temperatures.

### Ensemble Clustering Algorithm Development
**Description**: This project focused on developing an ensemble clustering algorithm that integrates the strengths of K-Means and DBSCAN. The goal was to create a robust clustering solution that minimizes the sensitivity to initial centroids and enhances clustering performance. The project involved iterating through multiple models to autonomously find optimal parameter values, handling different datasets effectively.

**Technologies and Tools Used**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, K-Means, DBSCAN, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy

**Key Achievements**:
- Developed an adaptive algorithm adjusting clustering parameters based on initial K-Means outputs.
- Enhanced handling of high-dimensional data and noisy datasets through improved parameter estimation techniques.
- Achieved refined clustering outcomes surpassing standard approaches.
